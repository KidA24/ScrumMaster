# Hi, I'm Erin
I'm looking forward to getting to know you! What this document is: A quick introduction to who I am, how I think, and how I work. It is not intended to override our personal interactions and mutual understanding that we'll build as we work together. 

## My Role as a Scrum Master
TL;DR: My goal as a Scrum Master is to help our team and organziation move further down this Agile path - to improve the way we work as well as the work we produce. I hope to do this through training, coaching, mentoring and facilitation. I might have thoughts on how we work as a team, and I expect you will too. The goal is to share these thoughts and consistently improve as a team moving forward. 

Long Term, my goal is to have the team become confident enough and to take over ownership of the Scrum process and work myself from being a permanent Scrum Master with the team to more of an as-needed consulting role (so that I can help other areas of the organization - including other teams). 

#### How do I do that? 
1. **Training:** I *know* Scrum. Scrum is a very simple framework, heck the PDF version of the [guide is only 19 pages.](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) It's easy to learn, but very difficult to master, and I will happily dive deep into the "Why" behind everything within Scrum. I want to teach you all about Scrum and Agile. 
2. **Coaching:** I want us to do the best work that we can. Coaching, in general, is on an individual basis. It will be focused on things you can do better as an individual on the team to help grow our agile mindset and deliver more value for our organization. 
3. **Mentoring:** I want to be someone who can offer advice and guidance. I want you to learn from my experiences, both my mistakes and my successes. 
4. **Facilitating:** You know your world, your organization, your code bases and your jobs better than I do. When I am facilitating, my goal is to create a safe space and allow you to dive into our problems, issues or successes and find ways for us to improve. 

Additionally: My job is **NOT** to tell you exactly what to do or how to do it. My goal is to become a valued member of the team, offer insights and help grow our relationships so we work more cohesively and deliver what our organization needs the most. 

## What I need your help with
1. **Commitment:** Commitment is about *dedication* and applies to our actions and effort as a team, not just the final result. We commit to each other, to learning, to self-organization, to quality, to look for ways to improve. 
2. **Curiosity and Courage:** When you have questions, ask them. When you think "Why are we doing this?" speak up. 
3. **Willingness to Experiment:** A huge part of becoming Agile is experimenting with how we work and trying new things. If the experiment doesn't work perfectly, we can always try something new (with doing things the old way as one of those options).
4. **Respect:** We are all peers. A big part of becoming a team is realizing that everyone is on the same footing and that ideas can come from anywhere. 

## Feedback
If you have feedback for me, please give it. If it's something you liked that I did, and want me to do more of it, tell me. If there's something you didn't like, or thought I could do better or something I completely screwed up... even if you think I might not want to hear it, trust me, I *do* want to hear it. 

I prefer to get feedback in person, however if you're not comfortable with that I'd rather you e-mail or message me in another fashion than not get that feedback at all. If you want to give direct feedback but aren't comfortable, let me know and we can talk through some techniques you can use and we can get better at it together. 

If you want more feedback, let me know! 

## Schedule
I'll do my best to set my schedule to be around for the team's core hours. Usually that's somewhere around 8-4. 

## One on Ones
I'll put a half hour (or an hour if you'd prefer) every other week on your schedule so we can have a one on one. This will usually be the week opposite our Sprint Review/Retro and Planning. 

One-on-Ones are *your time.* I will probably have some things to discuss with you, but first and foremost, this time is for you to let me know how you're doing, what you're struggling with, what you wish could be different, how you feel about our team and teammates and the direction we are heading. 

I encourage you to write things down when as they come up and it pops into your head, "Oh, I should talk to Erin about that," and bring that with you as a list of things to chat about (if it would help), sometimes I find it hard to recall things during a spur of the moment conversation. 

If you want to chat more often than that, please, let me know (and see below)!

## If you need something
My time is your time. My primary goal is to serve the team. Some weeks my schedule may be busy with doing other things (such as Road mapping or organizational coaching), but my team always has first priority. My time is your time. I am on a pull request for you. How can you do this? 
* Grab me at my desk. If I'm there, I probably have a moment to chat. If it's a bad time, I'll tell you and find sometime soon to have the conversation. 
* E-mail or message me. If you want to schedule some time to talk, in person, you can ask this way. If you'd rather chat over messages or e-mail, we can do that as well. 
* Put something on my calendar. Send me an invite. I'll share my calendar with the team so that you hopefully see when/where/why I've disappeared to if I'm not around. 

## My interests beyond Scrum and Agile (believe it or not)
* I love the outdoors. I love to hike, camp, and backpack. Almost every year I take a vacation centered around exploring a place I haven't been on foot with my tent, food and everything else strapped to my back. It's let me see some amazing things and explore some beautiful places.

* I ride my bicycle quite a bit. I have done the [Scenic Shore 150](https://events.lls.org/pages/wi/2019ScenicShore150/) two years in a row and have had a great time doing it. My brother-in-law is a Survivor and it's an absolute thrill to ride with him and my sister (pictured below) each year.

* I play [Ultimate Frisbee.](https://www.usaultimate.org/resources/officiating/rules/default.aspx#10simplerules) It helps keep me in shape and get me outside with close friends. I've made lifelong friends playing this game and it never ceases to amaze me what these great athletes can do [on the field.  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vSV6Wf7l_k)

* Boardgames. Seriously. I love them. I have a huge collection. It truly is the golden age of boardgames right now. 

* Cooking, Grilling and Tailgating. I like to throw a good party and I love the Milwaukee Brewers.... ask me about March Madness sometime.
